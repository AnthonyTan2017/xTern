I found the most popular places using Google maps api and the first return searches. I then graph the results by rating. I selected areas that were the closest by walking distance. As well as determining if the places were suitable for interns.
I find that Indiana scenery is a core part of Indiana and that the Canal walk would be the best place to start. As we visit museums and learn of museums and visit historical sites. The interns can work towards the city to more attractions. The city center also has a lot to explore.

For Lunch there are a lot of options in the city center, so depending on people’s food preferences we can split up then reconvene at a central set location. After eating I think that the Indianapolis Zoo is also one of the most iconic places to visit and no intern can leave Indiana if they haven’t been there.

For dinner, when I think of Iconic places I think of St. Elmo’s as it is one of the more well known restaurants in downtown Indy, and would be a great experience for everyone.

Most places close around 4 and the places that are open are mostly bars. I find that not all the interns may be 21 so it wasn’t too suitable. However, central Indy is totally different at night with all of the lights on. So I find that exploring the city at night is a whole new experience in it of itself
